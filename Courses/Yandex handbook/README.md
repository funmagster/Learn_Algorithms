# Basics of algorithms from Yandex
### [Description](https://education.yandex.ru/handbook/algorithms):
With this handbook, you will learn how to design, optimize, combine and debug algorithms - without being tied to any programming language. In addition to theory, we have also collected practical tasks of varying levels of complexity, and also prepared a system for automatically checking the effectiveness of algorithms - all this will help you consolidate and hone new skills.
### Progress
By today I have studied all the paragraphs and solved most of the problems. I will complete unfinished tasks later. I'm not doing the course right now.
